The course is not designed to teach students to become professional data scientists or software developers, but rather to build awareness of common AI workloads and the ability to identify Azure services to support them. The course is designed as a blended learning experience that combines instructor-led training with online materials on the Microsoft Learn platform (<a href=\"https://azure.com/learn\">https://azure.com/learn</a>). The hands-on exercises in the course are based on Learn modules, and students are encouraged to use the content on Learn as reference materials to reinforce what they learn in the class and to explore topics in more depth.</p>\n<h4 id=\"audience-profile\">Audience Profile</h4>\n<p>The Azure AI Fundamentals course is designed for anyone interested in learning about the types of solution artificial intelligence (AI) makes possible, and the services on Microsoft Azure that you can use to create them. You donâ€™t need to have any experience of using Microsoft Azure before taking this course, but a basic level of familiarity with computer technology and the Internet is assumed. Some of the concepts covered in the course require a basic understanding of mathematics, such as the ability to interpret charts. The course includes hands-on activities that involve working with data and running code, so a knowledge of fundamental programming principles will be helpful.</p>\n",

You then transition to configuring Microsoft 365, with a primary focus on configuring Office client connectivity. Finally, you explore how to manage user-driven client installations of Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise deployments.</p>\n<p>The course then transitions to an in-depth examination of Microsoft 365 identity synchronization, with a focus on Microsoft Entra Connect and Connect Cloud Sync. You learn how to plan for and implement each of these directory synchronization options, how to manage synchronized identities, and how to implement password management in Microsoft 365 using multifactor authentication and self-service password management.</p>\n<p>In Microsoft 365 security management, you begin examining the common types of threat vectors and data breaches facing organizations today. You then learn how Microsoft 365â€™s security solutions address each of these threats. You are introduced to the Microsoft Secure Score, as well as to Microsoft Entra ID Protection. You then learn how to manage the Microsoft 365 security services, including Exchange Online Protection, Safe Attachments, and Safe Links. Finally, you are introduced to the various reports that monitor an organizationâ€™s security health. You then transition from security services to threat intelligence; specifically, using Microsoft 365 Defender, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.</p>\n<p>Once you have this understanding of Microsoft 365â€™s security suite, you then examine the key components of Microsoft 365 compliance management. This begins with an overview of all key aspects of data governance, including data archiving and retention, Microsoft Purview message encryption, and data loss prevention (DLP). You then delve deeper into archiving and retention, paying particular attention to Microsoft Purview insider risk management, information barriers, and DLP policies. You then examine how to implement these compliance features by using data classification and sensitivity labels.</p>\n<h4 id=\"audience-profile\">Audience Profile</h4>\n<p>This course is designed for persons aspiring to the Microsoft 365 Administrator role and have completed at least one of the Microsoft 365 role-based administrator certification paths.</p>\n",

The course materials are maintained to reflect the latest version of the service at the time of writing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"IMPORTANT\">\n<p>Important</p>\n<p>To complete the hands-on labs in this course, students require an Azure subscription that has been approved for access to the Azure OpenAI service. Access approval can take several days to be granted. See <a href=\"/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access\">https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access</a> for details.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Azure OpenAI Service provides access to OpenAI's powerful large language models such as GPT; the model behind the popular ChatGPT service. These models enable various natural language processing (NLP) solutions to understand, converse, and generate content. Users can access the service through REST APIs, SDKs, and Azure OpenAI Studio. In this course, you'll learn how to provision Azure OpenAI service, deploy models, and use them in generative AI applications.</p>\n<h4 id=\"audience-profile\">Audience Profile</h4>\n<p>The audience for this course includes software developers and data scientists who need to use large language models for generative AI. Some programming experience is recommended, but the course will be valuable to anyone seeking to understand how the Azure OpenAI service can be used to implement generative AI solutions.</p>\n",

Transforming education by focusing on 21st century skills is one of Microsoft's focus areas, and providing workshops for educators on the 21CLD curriculum has been successful.</p>\n<p>The 21CLD curriculum - developed to enhance 21st century skills in student learning - builds on the 21CLD research methodology, providing a collaborative, practice-based process that helps educators transform how they design enriching learning activities for their learners. The eight courses incorporate online tutorials, video, readings, educator-discussion and self-assessment. Educators have the opportunity to actively engage with evidence of 21CLD in action in classes across the globe.</p>\n<p>The 21CLD curriculum is based on rubrics, which were developed and tested internationally for the Innovative Teaching and Learning (ITL) Research project. These rubrics help educators identify and understand the opportunities that learning activities give learners to build 21st century skills. A learning activity is any task that learners do as part of their school-related work. It can be an exercise that learners complete in one class period or an extended project that takes place both in and outside of school. The 21CLD rubrics incorporate a research-based methodology for coding learning activities to ensure you're embedding 21st century skills in your teaching practices.</p>\n",
